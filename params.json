{"name":"Omid","tagline":"Transactional Support for HBase","body":"Omid\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis project provides ACID transactional support for HBase.\r\n\r\nHBase lacks an ACID transaction manager. Thatâ€™s why, back in 2011, we started the Omid project at Yahoo, aiming to provide a transactional framework on top of HBase. During these years, the project has evolved and matured internally and now is used in production at Yahoo to provide the transactional guarantees required by several applications.\r\n\r\nOmid uses a lock-free approach to provide ACID transactions with Snapshot Isolation guarantees, resolving the possible conflicts among concurrent transactions through a centralized component. You can find more information in the [project wiki](https://github.com/yahoo/omid/wiki) \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
